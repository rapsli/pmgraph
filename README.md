PM Graph
========
I could not found an easy to use tool based on network graphs to do project management. So I started writing one my-self. Seems very straight forward and I'm collecting my first experiences with it. Probably overkill for really small projects and probably not up to the task for really big projects. Provides though a good overview of what needs to happen in the project.

This is still very early Alpha Phase and very ugly quick and dirty code ;) 

Demo can be found here: http://pmgraph-demo.rapsli.ch/. Data will reset every day at midnight
